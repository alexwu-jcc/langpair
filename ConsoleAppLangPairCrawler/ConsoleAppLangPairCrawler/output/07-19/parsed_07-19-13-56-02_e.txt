The small claims COVID-19 rental debt process
The small claims process is an easier way to take a tenant to court if they owe you COVID-19 rental debt
COVID-19 rental debt is rent due between March 1, 2020 and September 30, 2021
If you're suing about COVID-19 rental debt there is no limit to how much you can sue for in small claims court
Select any step to get instructions
 Ask tenant to pay you
Ask your tenant for the unpaid money. Help your tenant obtain rental assistance.
 Start a small claims case if they don't pay
File papers to start the case, get a court date, and officially let your tenant know you're suing them.
 Go to your court date
The judge listens to both sides, looks at evidence, and decides who wins or loses the case.
 After the trial – pay and collect
The side that was sued, lost and owes money may appeal (ask for a new trial). After an appeal is done or the time to file has run out, whoever won can collect their money.
